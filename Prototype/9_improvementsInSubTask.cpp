I apologize for the confusion. Without the specific code or problem statement, I cannot provide a tailored solution. However, I can give you some general guidelines on how to potentially improve a subtask using AVX2.

1. Vectorization: AVX2 is designed to process multiple data elements simultaneously using vector operations. To utilize AVX2, the code should be modified to operate on vector registers. This typically involves rearranging the data layout or using intrinsics for AVX2 instructions.

2. Data alignment: AVX2 instructions require data to be aligned on 32-byte boundaries. If the data is not aligned, it can result in performance penalties. Ensure that the data is properly aligned to make use of AVX2 optimizations.

3. Loop unrolling: Unrolling loops allows for better utilization of AVX2 instructions. It reduces the overhead of loop control and allows the compiler to generate more efficient code. Consider unrolling loops to improve performance with AVX2.

4. Memory access patterns: AVX2 provides efficient support for loading and storing data from memory. Optimize memory access patterns to make use of AVX2 load/store instructions, such as aligned/unaligned loads and scatter/gather operations.

5. Horizontal operations: AVX2 offers horizontal vector operations, which can be used to perform calculations across multiple elements in a vector register. Utilize horizontal operations where applicable to improve parallelism.

6. Compiler optimizations: Modern compilers can recognize and automatically generate AVX2 instructions when appropriate. Enable compiler optimizations and ensure that the compiler is set to use AVX2 instructions.

Please note that these are general guidelines, and the actual improvements will depend on the specific characteristics of the subtask and the code implementation. For a more detailed analysis and specific recommendations, provide the code or problem statement.
