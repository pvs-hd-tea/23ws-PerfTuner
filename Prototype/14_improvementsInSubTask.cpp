If you have a subtask that can be parallelized using AVX2, there are several ways you can improve it using AVX2 instructions. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Use Vectorization: AVX2 provides SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions that allow you to perform operations on multiple data elements simultaneously. This can significantly speed up your computations. Look for loops or operations that can be vectorized and rewrite them using AVX2 intrinsics or libraries that provide vectorized functions.

2. Efficient Memory Access: AVX2 allows you to load and store multiple data elements in a single instruction. Make sure that your memory access patterns are optimized to take advantage of this feature. For example, try to align your data structures to 32-byte boundaries to ensure efficient AVX2 memory access.

3. Fused Multiply-Add (FMA): AVX2 also introduces FMA instructions that combine multiplication and addition in a single instruction. This can help reduce the number of instructions needed for certain computations. Look for opportunities to use FMA instructions instead of separate multiply and add instructions.

4. Loop Unrolling: AVX2 can benefit from loop unrolling, which increases the number of loop iterations processed in parallel. Unrolling loops allows more operations to be performed in parallel and can improve overall performance.

5. Software Pipelining: Break your computation into smaller independent tasks and pipeline them using AVX2. This can overlap their execution and increase overall throughput.

6. Avoid Data Dependencies: AVX2 performs best when operations on different data elements can be executed independently. Try to minimize data dependencies to allow the CPU to perform operations in parallel.

7. Use Compiler Optimization: Make sure to enable appropriate compiler optimization flags to allow the compiler to generate efficient AVX2 code. This can include options like -mavx2, -O3, or -march=native depending on your compiler.

Remember that the exact optimizations will depend on the specific subtask and the computational requirements of your application. It's important to profile and benchmark different approaches to determine the most effective optimizations for your use case.
