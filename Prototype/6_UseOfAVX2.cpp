The subtask of printing the status of the matrix can be parallelized using AVX2. AVX2 is a vector instruction set that allows for parallel processing of multiple data elements. However, the specific implementation details would depend on the programming language and framework being used. Additionally, if there are any dependencies or ordering constraints in the printing process, those would need to be taken into consideration to ensure correct parallelization.
