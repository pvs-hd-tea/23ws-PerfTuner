3. Yes, matrix LU decomposition can be parallelized using AVX2. The computation of the pivot elements and the row operations can be divided among multiple threads or processes, allowing for parallel execution.

4. Yes, initializing a random array can be parallelized using AVX2. Different portions of the array can be assigned to different threads or processes, which can independently generate random values for their assigned portion using AVX2 instructions.

5. Yes, initializing a matrix can also be parallelized using AVX2. Different threads or processes can be assigned to different rows or columns of the matrix, allowing for concurrent initialization using AVX2 instructions.

6. No, printing the status of the matrix does not require parallelization. It is not a computationally-intensive task and does not involve modifying the matrix, so parallelization using AVX2 is not necessary.
