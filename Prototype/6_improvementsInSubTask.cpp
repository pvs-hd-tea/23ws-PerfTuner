To improve the subtask of printing the status of the matrix using AVX2, you can follow these steps:

1. Load the matrix data into AVX2 registers: AVX2 registers can hold multiple data elements (e.g., 8 floats or 4 double precision numbers) at once. Load the matrix data into these registers using AVX2 instructions like `_mm256_load_ps` or `_mm256_load_pd`.

2. Process the matrix data in parallel: Perform any necessary parallel operations on the matrix data using AVX2 instructions. For example, you can calculate the status of each element (e.g., maximum, minimum, sum, etc.) using instructions like `_mm256_max_ps`, `_mm256_min_ps`, or `_mm256_add_ps`.

3. Store the processed data back to memory: Once the matrix data has been processed, store the final results back to memory using AVX2 store instructions like `_mm256_store_ps` or `_mm256_store_pd`.

4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each block or partition of the matrix: To fully parallelize the task, divide the matrix into smaller blocks or partitions and repeat steps 1-3 for each block. This allows multiple AVX2 registers and cores to work concurrently on different portions of the matrix.

Note: The specific AVX2 instructions and coding techniques used may vary depending on the programming language, compiler, and library being used. It is also important to ensure proper alignment of memory access for AVX2 instructions to achieve optimal performance.
