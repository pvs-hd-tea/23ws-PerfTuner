I'm sorry, but without any specific information about the subtask you'd like to optimize using AVX2, I can't provide any specific guidance. AVX2 is a set of instructions that allows for SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations on modern x86 CPUs. It can be used to accelerate certain tasks by performing calculations on multiple data elements in parallel. To leverage AVX2 effectively, you typically need to rewrite or refactor the code to use vectorized instructions.

If you provide more details about the specific subtask you are working on, I would be happy to help you identify potential areas for AVX2 optimization.
