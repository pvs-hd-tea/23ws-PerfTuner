Apologies for the confusion. You are right, the "Read input" subtask cannot be parallelized using AVX2 as it involves sequential file reading and does not involve any specific vectorizable operations. AVX2 is designed for parallel processing and vector operations, so it is not applicable in this case.

For the "Read input" subtask, you can focus on optimizing the I/O operation itself rather than parallelizing it. Here are a few suggestions to improve the performance of reading input from a file:

1. Use buffered I/O: Reading data in larger chunks can improve performance. You can use the standard C library functions like `fread` or `fgets` to read data in larger buffer sizes.

2. Minimize disk access: If possible, try to read the entire file into memory at once rather than reading it line by line or character by character. This will reduce the number of disk accesses and speed up the reading process.

3. Use asynchronous I/O: If your platform supports it, you can consider using asynchronous I/O operations, such as `aio_read`, to overlap the input reading with other computations, making better use of system resources.

4. Optimize file access patterns: If your input file is stored on a spinning disk, optimizing the access patterns can help improve performance. Sequentially reading the file or using memory-mapped I/O can lead to better disk read efficiency.

5. Consider using a more efficient file format: Depending on the nature of your data, using a more efficient file format such as binary or a compressed format (e.g., HDF5) may speed up the reading process, as these formats can reduce the I/O overhead.

Remember that the "Read input" subtask is usually a small portion of the overall program execution time. Therefore, it might be more beneficial to focus on optimizing other computationally intensive parts of your program rather than spending too much effort on optimizing the file reading process.
