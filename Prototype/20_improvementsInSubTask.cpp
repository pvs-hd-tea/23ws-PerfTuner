To improve the subtask "2. Process data" using AVX2, you can follow these steps:

1. Reorganize the data: If possible, organize your data in a way that makes it suitable for AVX2 operations. AVX2 operates on 256-bit vectors, so arranging your data in chunks of 32 bytes or multiples of 32 bytes can optimize the AVX2 instructions.

2. Load data using AVX2 instructions: Use AVX2 load instructions like `_mm256_loadu_si256` to load data into AVX2 registers. Make sure that the data is aligned correctly to take advantage of the memory alignment benefits.

3. Perform operations using AVX2 instructions: Utilize AVX2 instructions to perform the required operations on the loaded data. For example, `_mm256_add_epi32` can be used for adding two vectors of 8 integers, `_mm256_mul_ps` for multiplying two vectors of 8 single-precision floating-point numbers, etc.

4. Store the results: After performing the operations, store the results using AVX2 store instructions like `_mm256_storeu_si256`. Again, ensure that the memory is aligned correctly for optimal performance.

5. Handle remaining elements: If the data size is not a multiple of the AVX2 vector size, you may have remaining elements that need to be handled separately. This usually requires using scalar instructions to perform the operations on the remaining elements.

6. Ensure loop unrolling: To achieve maximum throughput, you can consider unrolling the loop that processes the data using AVX2. This allows for better utilization of the pipeline and potentially reduces the number of instructions needed for handling loop control.

7. Avoid excessive memory transfers: Minimize unnecessary memory loads and stores by performing multiple operations on a single loaded vector before storing back the results.

8. Utilize other AVX2 instructions: AVX2 provides a wide range of instructions for different operations like shuffling, blending, comparisons, etc. Explore these instructions to see if they can further optimize your specific task.

Remember to profile and benchmark your code to determine the optimal settings and ensure that the AVX2 optimizations are providing the desired performance improvements.
