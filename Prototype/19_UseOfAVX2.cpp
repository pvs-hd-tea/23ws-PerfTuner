Yes, the subtask "Read input" can be parallelized using AVX2. AVX2 (Advanced Vector Extensions 2) is an x86 instruction set extension that supports vector operations on 256-bit registers. It provides a set of instructions specifically designed for parallel processing, such as SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations.

For parallelizing the "Read input" subtask with AVX2, you would need to determine if there are any specific operations within the task that can benefit from vectorization. AVX2 is typically used for performing computations on vectors, such as mathematical operations or data processing.

If the "Read input" subtask involves performing operations on the data read from the input file, such as applying a mathematical function or processing the data in batches, then AVX2 can be utilized to parallelize these operations. This would involve using AVX2 intrinsics or libraries that support AVX2 vectorization, such as Intel's Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP), to perform parallel computations on the input data.

However, if the "Read input" subtask is simply reading the input file sequentially without any specific operations on the data, then AVX2 is not applicable for parallelizing this subtask. In that case, you can proceed with a sequential implementation for reading the input file.
