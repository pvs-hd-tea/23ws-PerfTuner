AVX2 (Advanced Vector Extensions 2) is a set of instructions provided by Intel for performing SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations on modern x86 processors. AVX2 allows for parallel processing of multiple elements in a vector register.

In the case of the scalar product of two arrays, each pair of corresponding elements can indeed be processed in parallel using AVX2 instructions. AVX2 supports vector operations on 256-bit wide vectors, which can accommodate multiple elements of the arrays. The multiplication and addition operations required for the scalar product can be performed using AVX2 instructions, allowing for efficient parallelization of the subtask.

Therefore, the scalar product of two arrays can be parallelized using AVX2 instructions.
