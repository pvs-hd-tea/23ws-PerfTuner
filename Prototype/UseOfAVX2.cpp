Yes, the subtask of finding the scalar product of two arrays `a` and `b` can indeed be parallelized using AVX2. AVX2 (Advanced Vector Extensions 2) is an instruction set extension for x86 processors that provides SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions for performing parallel operations on vectors of data.

To parallelize the scalar product calculation using AVX2, you would need to divide the arrays `a` and `b` into chunks of data that can be processed in parallel. Each chunk can then be loaded into AVX2 registers, and the AVX2 instructions can be used to perform parallel operations on the vectorized data.

Here is a basic example of how the scalar product of two arrays `a` and `b` could be parallelized using AVX2 in C++:

```cpp
#include <immintrin.h> // Include AVX2 header

float scalarProduct(const float* a, const float* b, int size) {
  __m256 sumVector = _mm256_setzero_ps(); // Initialize vector to hold the sum

  for (int i = 0; i < size; i += 8) {
    __m256 aVector = _mm256_loadu_ps(&a[i]); // Load 8 floats from 'a' into a vector
    __m256 bVector = _mm256_loadu_ps(&b[i]); // Load 8 floats from 'b' into a vector

    __m256 productVector = _mm256_mul_ps(aVector, bVector); // Multiply corresponding elements

    sumVector = _mm256_add_ps(sumVector, productVector); // Accumulate the sum
  }

  // Reduce the sum across the vector lanes
  __m128 sumLow = _mm256_castps256_ps128(sumVector);
  __m128 sumHigh = _mm256_extractf128_ps(sumVector, 1);
  __m128 sum = _mm_add_ps(sumLow, sumHigh);
  float result[4];
  _mm_store_ps(result, sum);

  // Calculate the final scalar product
  float scalarProduct = result[0] + result[1] + result[2] + result[3];
  return scalarProduct;
}
```

In this example, the AVX2 instructions `_mm256_loadu_ps`, `_mm256_mul_ps`, `_mm256_add_ps`, and `_mm_store_ps` are used to load, multiply, accumulate, and store the vectorized data. The result is then reduced to a scalar product using standard scalar operations.

Note that this is a simplified example and there may be additional considerations depending on the specific requirements of your code, such as handling array sizes that are not multiples of 8 or aligning the data for better performance. It is recommended to consult the AVX2 documentation and consider other optimization techniques for maximal performance.
