Subtasks tackled:

1. The function `scalar_product_array` calculates the scalar product of two arrays using a loop. It initializes the variable `c` to 0 and then iterates over each element of the arrays `a` and `b`, multiplying the corresponding elements and adding them to `c`. This is a straightforward implementation of the scalar product calculation.

2. The function `add` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their sum. This is a simple addition operation.

3. The function `lu_1` implements the LU decomposition algorithm for solving a linear system of equations. It uses a standard kij version of the algorithm, where each element of the matrix `A` is calculated by subtracting the product of elements from the previous rows. The algorithm starts with row k (initialized to 0) and iterates over each row i from k+1 to n. For each row i, it normalizes the element A[i][k] by dividing it by A[k][k], and then subtracts A[i][k] * A[k][j] from A[i][j], where j goes from k+1 to n. This algorithm is used to compute the LU decomposition of the matrix A, which can be used to solve linear systems efficiently.

4. The function `setRand` initializes the array `randNum` with random numbers between 0 and 1. It uses the `std::rand()` function to generate random numbers and assigns them to each element of the array.

5. The function `initialize` sets the initial values of the matrix `A`. It sets the diagonal elements to 1 and the off-diagonal elements to 0. It also sets the last column of the matrix to the values from 0 to n-1. Then, it mixes up the matrix by adding random numbers from the `randNum` array to the elements of the matrix.

6. The function `print` prints the status of the matrix `A` by iterating over each row and column and printing the corresponding element.

7. The `main` function calls the `setRand` function to initialize the random array, then calls the `initialize` function to set the initial values of the matrix, and finally calls the `lu_1` function to perform the LU decomposition.

Possible improvements:

1. The `scalar_product_array` function could be improved by using the `std::inner_product` algorithm from the `<numeric>` header instead of manually calculating the scalar product in a loop. This would provide a more concise and efficient implementation.

2. The `lu_1` function could be improved by using parallelization techniques such as SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, OpenMP, or parallel computing libraries. This would allow for faster computation of the LU decomposition on systems with multiple cores or processors.

3. The `setRand` function could be improved by using a more reliable random number generator such as the `<random>` library instead of `std::rand()`. The `<random>` library provides better quality random numbers and more control over the random number generation process.

4. The `initialize` function could be improved by avoiding unnecessary nested loops in the mixing up of the matrix. This can be achieved by using a single loop over k and modifying the elements of the matrix directly, instead of using nested loops over i and j.

5. The `print` function could be improved by using stream manipulators such as `std::setw` to ensure consistent spacing between elements, making the output more readable.

6. The code lacks error handling and input validation. It would be good to add checks for valid array sizes and handle any potential errors that may arise during the execution of the code.
