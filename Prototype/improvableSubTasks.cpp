Based on the information provided, the first subtask is "Scalar product of two arrays."

In order to determine if this subtask can be parallelized, we need to consider if there are any dependencies or conflicts between the operations being performed on the arrays.

In the case of the scalar product of two arrays, the operation involves multiplying corresponding elements of the arrays and summing up the results. This operation is inherently parallelizable since there are no dependencies between the elements being multiplied or summed. Each pair of corresponding elements can be processed independently.

Therefore, the first subtask, the scalar product of two arrays, can indeed be parallelized.
