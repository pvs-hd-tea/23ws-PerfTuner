Yes, the first subtask, finding the scalar product of two arrays `a` and `b`, can be parallelized. Since the scalar product operation is independent for each element of the arrays, the calculation can be divided among multiple parallel threads or processes. This can lead to improved performance and speedup when executing the code on multi-core or distributed computing systems.
