The subtask of printing the status of the matrix can generally be parallelized. Each element of the matrix can be printed independently, so multiple threads can be used to print different elements simultaneously. However, if there are any dependencies or ordering constraints in the printing process, parallelization might not be possible or might require additional synchronization mechanisms.
