To improve the given subtask "Process data" using AVX2, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the data processing operation that can be vectorized using AVX2. This can be any operation that can be applied to multiple elements of the data simultaneously, such as addition, multiplication, or mathematical functions like square root, sine, cosine, etc.

2. Ensure that the data is properly aligned in memory to take advantage of AVX2 instructions. AVX2 instructions work on 256-bit registers, which means that the data should be aligned on a 32-byte boundary.

3. Use AVX2 intrinsic functions to perform the vectorized operations. Intrinsics are special functions provided by compilers that allow direct access to AVX2 instructions. They provide a convenient way to write code that leverages AVX2 without having to write assembly language code.

4. Divide the data into chunks of 8 or 16 elements, depending on the size of the data type you are working with. AVX2 instructions can operate on 8 single-precision floating-point values (float) or 4 double-precision floating-point values (double) at once.

5. Load the data from memory into AVX2 registers using intrinsics like `_mm256_load_ps` for floats or `_mm256_load_pd` for doubles.

6. Perform the desired vectorized operation using AVX2 intrinsics. For example, you can use `_mm256_add_ps` for vector addition or `_mm256_mul_ps` for vector multiplication.

7. Store the results back into memory using intrinsics like `_mm256_store_ps` for floats or `_mm256_store_pd` for doubles.

8. Repeat the above steps for the remaining chunks of data until all the elements have been processed.

By following these steps, you will be able to utilize the parallel processing capabilities of AVX2 and significantly improve the performance of the "Process data" subtask.
