Yes, the subtask "Initialize variables" can be parallelized using AVX2. The AVX2 instruction set provides a set of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions that can operate on multiple data elements in parallel. This allows for efficient parallelization of tasks that involve repetitive operations on large arrays or vectors, such as initializing variables.
