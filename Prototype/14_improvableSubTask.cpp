Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine if the first subtask can be parallelized without knowing the specific details of the computation being performed in subtask 3. Parallelization depends on the nature of the computation and whether it can be divided into independent parts that can be executed simultaneously. Therefore, without more information, it is not possible to determine if subtask 3 can be parallelized.
