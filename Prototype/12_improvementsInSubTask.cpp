To improve the "Initialize variables" subtask using AVX2, you can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of variables to be initialized and divide it by the SIMD width supported by AVX2 (which is 256 bits or 32 bytes).

2. Allocate memory aligned to the AVX2 SIMD width (32-byte aligned) to ensure efficient memory access.

3. Use the AVX2 intrinsic functions provided by your programming language/compiler to perform the parallel initialization. These intrinsic functions allow you to directly utilize AVX2 instructions in your code.

4. Split the initialization task into multiple steps, each processing a chunk of variables equal to the SIMD width. Load the initial values into AVX2 registers using load instructions, such as `_mm256_set1_epi32` or `_mm256_set1_ps` depending on the data type.

5. Perform the initialization operation using SIMD instructions, such as `_mm256_store_ps` for floats or `_mm256_store_si256` for integers. This instruction will store the initialized values back into the memory.

6. Repeat the above steps until all the variables are initialized. Depending on the remaining count, it may be necessary to handle the remaining variables separately.

By parallelizing the initialization using AVX2, you will be able to initialize multiple variables simultaneously, significantly improving the performance compared to a serial approach. Remember to consider memory alignment, data types, and appropriate AVX2 intrinsic functions specific to your programming language and compiler.
