I apologize for the confusion. If the subtask can be parallelized using AVX2, here are some steps to improve it:

1. Identify the loop that performs the subtask. AVX2 instructions operate on vectors of 256 bits, so make sure that the loop processes data in chunks that align with this size.

2. Use AVX2 instructions to load and store data. AVX2 provides SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) capabilities, allowing for parallel processing of multiple values in a single instruction. Load the data from memory into AVX2 registers using the appropriate instructions such as `_mm256_load_ps` or `_mm256_loadu_ps`. Similarly, store the results back to memory using `_mm256_store_ps` or `_mm256_storeu_ps`.

3. Utilize AVX2 intrinsics for computations. AVX2 provides a wide range of computational instructions for various operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and bitwise operations. Replace the scalar operations in the loop with their AVX2 equivalents. For example, replace an addition operation with `_mm256_add_ps` or a multiplication operation with `_mm256_mul_ps`.

4. Unroll the loop to process multiple iterations in parallel. AVX2 allows for efficient loop unrolling by processing multiple data elements simultaneously. Unrolling the loop reduces the number of loop iterations and improves the overall performance.

5. Align memory accesses to improve performance. AVX2 instructions work most efficiently when the memory accesses are aligned to 32-byte boundaries. If possible, align the input and output arrays accordingly to maximize performance.

6. Enable compiler optimizations. Make sure to use appropriate compiler flags to enable AVX2 support and allow the compiler to optimize the code effectively. For example, use `-mavx2` flag with GCC or Clang.

It is important to note that the exact optimizations and techniques may vary depending on the specific subtask at hand. Therefore, it is recommended to refer to the Intel Intrinsics Guide (https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/) and consult the architecture-specific documentation for further details.
