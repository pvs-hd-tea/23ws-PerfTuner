The subtask "Declare variables" can indeed be parallelized using AVX2. We can declare multiple variables simultaneously using AVX2's vector operations. However, since declaring variables is a very simple and fast operation, the overhead of parallelization might not be justified, and it might not result in significant performance improvements.
