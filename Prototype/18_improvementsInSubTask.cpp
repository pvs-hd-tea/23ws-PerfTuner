To parallelize the "Validate input" subtask using AVX2, you can use the following approach:

1. Convert the input data to AVX2 vectors: Convert the individual input elements into AVX2 vectors, where each vector can hold multiple input elements. This is done using AVX2 specific loading instructions like `_mm256_loadu_si256()`.

2. Perform necessary data validation operations: Use AVX2 vectorized instructions to perform the necessary data validation operations on the input data. For example, if you need to check if the input elements are within a specific range, you can use `_mm256_cmpgt_epi32()` or `_mm256_cmplt_epi32()` to compare the input vectors with the desired range vectors. These instructions will perform the comparison operation on all the elements within the vector simultaneously.

3. Extract the validation results: Use AVX2 specific instructions like `_mm256_movemask_epi8()` to extract the validation results from the vectorized comparison operation. This instruction will generate a bitmask where each bit represents the validity of a specific element in the vector.

4. Merge and process the validation results: Use bitwise operations like `AND` or `OR` to combine the individual bitmasks from different vectors into a single bitmask that represents the overall validity of the input data.

5. Extract the validated data: Use AVX2 specific instructions like `_mm256_extract_epi32()` or `_mm256_extract_epi64()` to extract the validated data elements from the vectors. This is done by copying the valid elements from the input vectors to the output arrays.

By parallelizing the "Validate input" subtask using AVX2, you can significantly improve the performance as you can process multiple data elements in parallel using the vectorized operations.
