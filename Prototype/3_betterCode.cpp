Since the code you provided only contains the printing of the matrix, here's an example of how you can optimize the printing process using AVX2 instructions:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <immintrin.h>

void printMatrixAVX(float* matrix, int rows, int cols) {
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j += 8) {
            // Load 8 elements at a time into an AVX register
            __m256 rowValues = _mm256_loadu_ps(matrix + (i * cols) + j);

            // Print 8 elements in parallel
            std::cout << "Row " << i << ", Elements " << j << " to " << (j + 7) << ": ";
            for (int k = 0; k < 8; k++) {
                std::cout << ((float*)&rowValues)[k] << " ";
            }
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    int rows = 4;
    int cols = 12;
    float matrix[rows][cols] = {
        {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12},
        {13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24},
        {25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36},
        {37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48}
    };

    printMatrixAVX((float*)matrix, rows, cols);

    return 0;
}
```

This code takes advantage of AVX2 instructions to load 8 elements at a time into an AVX register and then prints those elements in parallel using AVX2 instructions. This results in improved performance compared to printing each element individually.

Note that in order to use AVX2 instructions, you need to compile your code with the appropriate flags (`-mavx2` for GCC or Clang, and `/arch:AVX2` for MSVC).
