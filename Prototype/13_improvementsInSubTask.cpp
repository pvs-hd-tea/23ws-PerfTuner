To parallelize the subtask of reading input using AVX2, you can follow these steps:

1. Align the input data: AVX2 instructions work on 256-bit alignment. If your input data is not already aligned, create aligned buffers or use alignment directives to ensure proper alignment.

2. Load the data using AVX2 load instructions: Use AVX2 load instructions (e.g., `_mm256_loadu_ps`, `_mm256_load_si256`) to load 256 bits (32 bytes) of data into a single AVX2 register. You can read up to eight float or integer values at a time (depending on the data type).

3. Process the loaded data in parallel: Once the data is loaded into AVX2 registers, you can perform parallel operations on all the elements simultaneously. AVX2 provides a wide range of SIMD instructions to perform operations like additions, subtractions, multiplications, and more in parallel.

4. Store the results using AVX2 store instructions: After processing the data, use AVX2 store instructions (e.g., `_mm256_storeu_ps`, `_mm256_store_si256`) to store the results back into memory. Similar to loading, you can store up to eight values at a time.

By parallelizing the input reading using AVX2, you can significantly improve the performance of the subtask. However, keep in mind that the effectiveness of AVX2 parallelization depends on the nature of the input data and the operations being performed. It's also crucial to ensure proper alignment for optimal performance.
