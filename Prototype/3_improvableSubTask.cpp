3. It is possible to parallelize the implementation of matrix LU decomposition using the standard kij version. This involves breaking down the computation of the LU decomposition into several parallelizable tasks, such as calculating the pivot elements and performing the row operations concurrently.

4. Initializing a random array can typically be parallelized by assigning different portions of the array to different threads or processes, which can independently generate random values for their assigned portion.

5. Initializing a matrix can also be parallelized in a similar way as initializing a random array. Different threads or processes can be assigned to different rows or columns of the matrix to initialize them concurrently.

6. Printing the status of the matrix is usually not a computationally-intensive task and does not involve modifying the matrix. Thus, it does not require parallelization.
