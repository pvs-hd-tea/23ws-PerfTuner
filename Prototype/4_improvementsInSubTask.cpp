To improve the subtask of initializing a random array using AVX2, you can follow the steps below:

1. Understand the AVX2 register size: AVX2 registers are 256 bits wide and can hold either 8 single-precision floating-point numbers (float) or 4 double-precision floating-point numbers (double).

2. Generate random data in batches: Instead of generating one random number at a time, generate a batch of multiple random numbers equal to the number of elements that can fit in an AVX2 register.

3. Use the AVX2 instructions to populate the array: AVX2 provides instructions to load and store data to and from memory in parallel, which can significantly speed up the initialization process. For example:

   a. Load the random data batch into an AVX2 register: Use the `_mm256_loadu_ps` or `_mm256_loadu_pd` instruction to load the random values into an AVX2 register. Ensure that the input data is properly aligned.

   b. Store the values from the AVX2 register to the array: Use the `_mm256_storeu_ps` or `_mm256_storeu_pd` instruction to store the values from the AVX2 register directly into the array.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the entire array is initialized: If the array size is not a multiple of the AVX2 register size, calculate the remaining elements and handle them separately using scalar instructions.

By utilizing AVX2, you can take advantage of parallelism to initialize a random array efficiently. Note that AVX2 instructions require appropriate compiler support and alignment considerations.
