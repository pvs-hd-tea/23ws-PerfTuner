To improve the subtask using AVX2, you can follow these steps:

1. Load the arrays into AVX2 registers: Load two 256-bit vectors, each containing multiple elements from the two arrays. AVX2 supports loading and storing of multiple elements at once, which can significantly improve performance.

2. Multiply the elements in the vectors: Use the AVX2 instruction `vmulps` (vector multiply packed single precision) to perform element-wise multiplication between the two vectors. This instruction multiplies four single-precision floating-point numbers in parallel.

3. Sum the multiplied elements: Use the AVX2 instruction `vaddps` (vector add packed single precision) to perform element-wise addition between the multiplied vectors. This instruction adds four single-precision floating-point numbers in parallel.

4. Extract the final sum: Extract the scalar product by summing the four elements in the resulting vector. You can use horizontal addition instructions such as `haddps` (horizontal add packed single precision) or `dpps` (dot product packed single precision) to efficiently obtain the final sum.

5. Store the result: Store the final scalar product in the desired memory location, using AVX2 instructions such as `vstoreps` (vector store packed single precision) to store multiple elements at once.

By utilizing AVX2 instructions, you can perform parallel processing of multiple elements, resulting in faster execution of the subtask. It is important to ensure that the arrays being operated on have a size that is a multiple of the number of elements processed in parallel to fully utilize the AVX2 instructions.
