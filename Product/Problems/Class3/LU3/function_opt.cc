Based on the original function, I will optimize the relevant subtasks using AVX intrinsics. Here are the modified subtasks:

1. Update `t` by dividing it by `l`:
```cpp
t /= l;
```
No optimization is needed for this step as it does not involve vectorized operations.

2. Perform calculations on the elements of `A[j][i]` using AVX intrinsics:
```cpp
int vec_size = 4;
__m256d vec1, vec2, factor;
factor = _mm256_set1_pd(t);
int i = lower;
for (; i <= upper - vec_size; i += vec_size)
{
  vec1 = _mm256_loadu_pd(&A[c][i]);
  vec2 = _mm256_loadu_pd(&A[j][i]);
  vec2 = _mm256_fnmadd_pd(factor, vec1, vec2);
  _mm256_storeu_pd(&A[j][i], vec2);
}
for (; i < upper; i += 1)
{
  A[j][i] -= t * A[c][i];
}
```
In this optimized subtask, we set `vec_size` to 4, as AVX can process 4 double values at a time. We define `vec1` and `vec2` as `__m256d` variables to hold the AVX registers, and `factor` to store the constant value of `t`.

Inside the loop, we load 4 double values from `A[c][i]` into `vec1` using `_mm256_loadu_pd()`, and load 4 double values from `A[j][i]` into `vec2`. We then perform the subtraction operation of `vec2 = vec2 - factor * vec1` using `_mm256_fnmadd_pd()`.

After the vectorized loop, we handle the remaining elements sequentially by subtracting `t * A[c][i]` from `A[j][i]` inside the loop.

By utilizing AVX intrinsics, we can process multiple elements in parallel, which can lead to significant performance improvements compared to the original version.
